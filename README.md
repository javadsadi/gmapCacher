# gmapCacher
A program to prefetch tiles for offline use in Gmap.Net


(mostly copied from Gmap NET Demo source)

The Files are stored in C:\Users\[your user name]\AppData\Local\GMap.NET\TileDBv5\en

Once you've successfully prefetched the tiles you can export the *.gmdb files to the same location in the offline pc and it should use it (by importing *.gmdb files)
